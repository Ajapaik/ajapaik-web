            parties
            such as web analytics partners and application developers. If your IP address is shared, it
            may
            be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have
            visited the website in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the website. They may
            aggregate

            We only send emails to
            people who have authorized us to contact
            them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we
            hate spam as much as you do. We may send newsletters to users who have accepted newsletters on our website.
            <br><br>
            <h3>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3>
            We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Ajapaik to you and fulfill the purposes
            described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who
            carries
            out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to
            keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or
            depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.
            <br><br>
            <h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
            We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you
            enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server.
            All
            supplied personal information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then
            encrypted into our database only to be accessible by those authorized with
            special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. Ajapaik does
            not store any user sensitive information, only personal information as stated in "What Information Do We
            Collect?"
            We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Ajapaik
            or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a
            breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
            Could my information be transferred to other
            countries?
            Ajapaik is incorporated in Estonia. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with
            you,
            or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to
            third
            parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including
            countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To
            the
            fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the
            trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Is the information collected through the Ajapaik
                Service secure?</h3>
            We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and
            managerial
            procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your
            information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In
            addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while
            we
            use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If
            applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that
            intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Can I update or correct my information?</h3>
            The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information Ajapaik collects depend on your
            relationship with Ajapaik. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal
            NPO policies.
            Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally
            identifiable
            information as follows.
            <br><br>
            <strong>You can contact us in order to:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li> update or correct your personally identifiable
                    information
                </li>
                <li> change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive
                    from us,
                </li>
                <li>delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject
                    to
                    the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and
                    deletions
                    will
                    have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third
                    parties
                    in
                    accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect
                    your
                    privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify
                    your
                    identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for
                    maintaining
                    the
                    secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
            </ol>
            You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the
            information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect
            information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable
            form
            that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all
            personal
            information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated,
            corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and
            technically
            practicable.
            If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you
            may do
            so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.
            Personnel
            If you are a Ajapaik worker or applicant, we collect information you voluntarily provide to us. We
            use the
            information collected for Human Resources purposes in order to administer benefits to workers and
            screen
            applicants.
            <br><br>
            <strong>You may contact us in order to</strong>

                    with
                    respect to communications and other information you receive from us

                <li>receive a record of the
                    information we have relating to you. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no
                    effect on
                    other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in
                    accordance with
                    this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.

            <h3>Merger of NPO</h3>
            We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of merger or
            other
            transfer of
            all or substantially all of the assets of Ajapaik or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined
            herein), or
            that
            portion of Ajapaik or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event
            that we
            discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy,
            reorganization or
            similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy
            Policy.
            Affiliates
            We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates.
            For

            indirectly
            controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Ajapaik, whether by ownership or

            information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those
            Corporate
            Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

            <h3> Information about General Data Protection
                Regulation (GDPR)
            </h3>
            We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area
            (EEA),
            and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data
            collected,
            and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
            <br><br>
            <h3> What is GDPR?</h3>
            GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is
            protected by
            companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.
            The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU
            residents. Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we
            have
            implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.
            <br><br>
            <h3> What is personal data?</h3>
            Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of
            information
            that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a
            person.
            Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial
            information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address,
            sexual
            orientation, and ethnicity.
            The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be
                    used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.
                </li>
                <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for
                    that
                    purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.
                </li>
                <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.
                </li>
                <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request
                    a
                    copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another
                    organization.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why is GDPR important?</h3>
            GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data
            that
            they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and
            imposing
            greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Ajapaik we
            strongly
            believe
            that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in
            place
            that
            go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
            Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access,
            Portability and Deletion
            We are committed to helping our users meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Ajapaik
            processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all
            conversation
            and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all
            data in
            accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60
            days.
            We are aware that if you are working with EU users, you need to be able to provide them with the
            ability
            to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self-service
            from
            the start and have always given you access to your data and your users' data. Our customer
            support is available for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.
