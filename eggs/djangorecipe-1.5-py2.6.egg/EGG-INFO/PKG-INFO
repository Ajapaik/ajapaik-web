        This buildout recipe can be used to create a setup for Django. It will
        automatically download Django and install it in the buildout's
        sandbox.
        
        You can see an example of how to use the recipe below::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = satchmo django
          eggs =
            ipython
          versions = versions
        
          [versions]
          django = 1.2.5
        
        
          [satchmo]
          recipe = gocept.download
          url = http://www.satchmoproject.com/snapshots/satchmo-0.6.tar.gz
          md5sum = 659a4845c1c731be5cfe29bfcc5d14b1
        
          [django]
          recipe = djangorecipe
          settings = development
          eggs = ${buildout:eggs}
          extra-paths =
            ${satchmo:location}
          project = dummyshop
        
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options.
        
        project
          This option sets the name for your project. The recipe will create a
          basic structure if the project is not already there.
        
        projectegg
          Use this instead of the project option when you want to use an egg
          as the project. This disables the generation of the project
          structure.
        
        settings
          You can set the name of the settings file which is to be used with
          this option. This is useful if you want to have a different
          production setup from your development setup. It defaults to
          `development`.
        
        extra-paths
          All paths specified here will be used to extend the default Python
          path for the `bin/*` scripts.
        
        pth-files
          Adds paths found from a site `.pth` file to the extra-paths.
          Useful for things like Pinax which maintains its own external_libs dir.
        
        control-script
          The name of the script created in the bin folder. This script is the
          equivalent of the `manage.py` Django normally creates. By default it
          uses the name of the section (the part between the `[ ]`).
        
        initialization
          Specify some Python initialization code to be inserted into the
          `control-script`. This is very limited. In particular, be aware that
          leading whitespace is stripped from the code given.
        
        wsgi
          An extra script is generated in the bin folder when this is set to
          `true`. This can be used with mod_wsgi to deploy the project. The
          name of the script is `control-script.wsgi`.
        
        wsgilog
          In case the WSGI server you're using does not allow printing to stdout,
          you can set this variable to a filesystem path - all stdout/stderr data
          is redirected to the log instead of printed
        
        fcgi
          Like `wsgi` this creates an extra script within the bin folder. This
          script can be used with an FCGI deployment.
        
        test
          If you want a script in the bin folder to run all the tests for a
          specific set of apps this is the option you would use. Set this to
          the list of app labels which you want to be tested.
        
        testrunner
          This is the name of the testrunner which will be created. It
          defaults to `test`.
        
        All following options only have effect when the project specified by
        the project option has not been created already.
        
        urlconf
          You can set this to a specific url conf. It will use project.urls by
          default.
        
        secret
          The secret to use for the `settings.py`, it generates a random
          string by default.
        
        
        FCGI specific settings
        ======================
        
        Options for FCGI can be set within a settings file (`settings.py`). The options
        is `FCGI_OPTIONS`. It should be set to a dictionary. The part below is an
        example::
        
          FCGI_OPTIONS = {
              'method': 'threaded',
          }
        
        
        Another example
        ===============
        
        The next example shows you how to use some more of the options::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = django extras
          eggs =
            hashlib
        
          [extras]
          recipe = iw.recipe.subversion
          urls =
            http://django-command-extensions.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-command-extensions
            http://django-mptt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-mptt
        
          [django]
          recipe = djangorecipe
          settings = development
          project = exampleproject
          wsgi = true
          eggs =
            ${buildout:eggs}
          test =
            someapp
            anotherapp
        
        Example using .pth files
        ========================
        
        Pinax uses a .pth file to add a bunch of libraries to its path; we can
        specify it's directory to get the libraries it specified added to our
        path::
        
          [buildout]
          parts	= PIL
        	  svncode
        	  myproject
          versions=versions
        
          [versions]
          django	= 1.3
        
          [PIL]
          recipe	= zc.recipe.egg:custom
          egg		= PIL
          find-links	= http://dist.repoze.org/
        
          [svncode]
          recipe	= iw.recipe.subversion
          urls		= http://svn.pinaxproject.com/pinax/tags/0.5.1rc1	pinax
        
          [myproject]
          recipe	= djangorecipe
          eggs		=
            PIL
          project	= myproject
          settings	= settings
          extra-paths	= ${buildout:directory}/myproject/apps
        		  ${svncode:location}/pinax/apps/external_apps
        		  ${svncode:location}/pinax/apps/local_apps
          pth-files	= ${svncode:location}/pinax/libs/external_libs
          wsgi		= true
        
        Above, we use stock Pinax for pth-files and extra-paths paths for
        apps, and our own project for the path that will be found first in the
        list.  Note that we expect our project to be checked out (e.g., by
        svn:external) directly under this directory in to 'myproject'.
        
        
        Example with a Django version from a repository
        ===============================================
        
        If you want to use a specific Django version from a source
        repository you could use mr.developer: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.developer
        Here is an example for using the Django development version::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = django
          extensions = mr.developer
          auto-checkout = *
        
          [sources]
          django = git https://github.com/django/django.git
        
          [django]
          recipe = djangorecipe
          settings = settings
          project = project
        
        Example configuration for mod_wsgi
        ==================================
        
        If you want to deploy a project using mod_wsgi you could use this
        example as a starting point::
        
          <Directory /path/to/buildout>
                 Order deny,allow
                 Allow from all
          </Directory>
          <VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:80>
                 ServerName      my.rocking.server
                 CustomLog       /var/log/apache2/my.rocking.server/access.log combined
                 ErrorLog        /var/log/apache2/my.rocking.server/error.log
                 WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/buildout/bin/django.wsgi
          </VirtualHost>
        
        Generating a control script for PyDev
        =====================================
        
        Running Django with auto-reload in PyDev requires adding a small snippet
        of code::
        
          import pydevd
          pydevd.patch_django_autoreload(patch_remote_debugger=False, patch_show_console=True)
        
        just before the `if __name__ == "__main__":` in the `manage.py` module
        (or in this case the control script that is generated). This example
        buildout generates two control scripts: one for command-line usage and
        one for PyDev, with the required snippet, using the recipe's
        `initialization` option::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = django pydev
          eggs =
            mock
        
          [django]
          recipe = djangorecipe
          eggs = ${buildout:eggs}
          project = dummyshop
        
          [pydev]
          <= django
          initialization =
            import pydevd
            pydevd.patch_django_autoreload(patch_remote_debugger=False, patch_show_console=True)
        
        Several wsgi scripts for one Apache virtual host instance
        =========================================================
        
        There is a problem when several wsgi scripts are combined in a single virtual
        host instance of Apache. This is due to the fact that Django uses the
        environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE. This variable  gets set once when
        the first wsgi script loads. The rest of the wsgi scripts will fail, because
        they need a different settings modules. However the environment variable
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is only set once. The new `initialization` option that has
        been added to djangorecipe can be used to remedy this problem as shown below::
        
            [django]
            settings = acceptance
            initialization =
                import os
                os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = '${django:project}.${django:settings}'
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        1.5 (2013-01-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed support for a different python version than the one you use to run
          buildout with. Previously, you could run your buildout with 2.6 but get
          Django to use 2.7 instead. zc.buildout 2.0 doesn't allow it anymore, so we
          removed it too.
        
        
        1.4 (2013-01-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Added initialization code support. Thanks to anshumanb, jjmurre. (Closes #58).
        
        
        1.3 (2012-09-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed deprecation warning in Django 1.4. Fixes #49, thanks Shagi.
        
        - Added documentation for use with mr.developer. Thanks shagi (closes issue #45)
        
        - Added Travis support.
        
        
        1.2.1 (2012-05-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed broken 1.2 release (missing ``*.rst`` files due to a recent txt-to-rst
          rename action).
        
        
        1.2 (2012-05-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed location path from recipe. Thanks bleskes (fixes issue #50).
        
        1.1.2
        -----
        
        - Added correct url to the deprecation warning

        - Fixed Python3 Trove classifiers
        
        1.1
        ---
        
        - Support python3.
        - Changed buildout and the tests to run the tests under nose.
        - Removed some old pre 0.99 unittests that dealt with download support.

        ---
        
        - Stable release with a real 1.0 version.
        - Made djangorecipe more pep08 compliant.
        
        0.99
        ----
        
        - Djangorecipe now depends on Django. The use of the `version =` statement
          is deprecated. Specify the django version in the
          `[versions]` section. Install django via mr.developer if you need to use
          an svn/git/hg repository. For other uses
          Versionpin djangorecipe to 0.23.1 if you don't want to upgrade.
          Thanks to Reinout van Rees for help with this release.
        
        - Removed subversion and download support.
        
        0.23.1

        - Added a missing 'import os'
        
        0.23
        ----
        
        - Support for settings/urls boilerplate for django 1.2 and django 1.3.
          It defaults to 1.3 when the version isn't 1.2.
        
        0.22
        ----
        
        - Added support for svn urls with spaces. Thanks to Brad103 (fixes #537718).
        
        - Updated code and buildout to use newest zc.recipe.egg,
          zc.recipe.testrunner and python-dateutil.
        
        0.21
        ----
        
        - The admin url is now configured for django 1.1 or higher. Thanks to
          Sam Charrington (fixes #672220).
        
        - Bootstrap.py updated (fixes #501954).
        
        0.20
        ----
        
        - The recipe know makes the `django` package know to setuptools during install.
          This closes #397864. Thanks to Daniel Bruce and Dan Fairs for the patch.
        
        - Fixed #451065 which fixes a problem with the WSGI log file option.
        
        - Added the posibilty to configure more FCGI related settings. Thanks to Vasily
          Sulatskov for the patch.
        
        0.19.2
        ------
        
        - The generated WSGI & FCGI scripts are now properly removed when
          options change (fixes #328182). Thanks to Horst Gutmann for the
          patch.
        
        - Scripts are now updated when dependencies change. This fixes #44658,
          thanks to Paul Carduner for the patch.
        
        0.19.1
        ------
        
        - Applied fix for the change in WSGI script generation. The previous
          release did not work properly.
        
        0.19
        ----
        
        - When running again with non-newest set the recipe will no longer
          update the Subversion checkout. Thanks to vinilios for the patch.
        
        - The WSGI and FCGI scripts are now generated using Buildout's own
          system. This makes them more similar to the generated manage script
          with regard to the setup of paths. Thanks to Jannis Leidel for the
          patch.
        
        0.18
        ----
        
        - Paths from eggs and extra-paths now get precedence over the default
          system path (fixes #370420). Thanks to Horst Gutmann for the patch.
        
        - The generated WSGI script now uses the `python` option if
          present. This fixes #361695.
        
        0.17.4
        ------
        
        - Fixed a problem when not running in verbose mode (fixes #375151).

        - Removed dependency on setuptools_bzr since it does not seem to work
          like I expected.
        
        0.17.2
        ------
        
        - Changed the download code to use urllib2. This should make it work
          from behind proxies (fixes #362822). Thanks to pauld for the patch.
        
        0.17.1
        ------
        
        - Fixed a problem with the new WSGI logging option #348797. Thanks to
          Bertrand Mathieu for the patch.
        
        - Disable generation of the WSGI log if "wsgilog" isn't set, thanks to
          Jacob Kaplan-Moss for the patch.
        
        - Updated buildout.cfg and .bzrignore, thanks Jacob Kaplan-Moss.

        ----
        
        - Added an option to specify a log file for output redirection from
          the WSGI script. Thanks to Guido Wesdorp for the patch.
        
        0.16
        ----
        
        - Subversion aliases are now supported (something like
          svn+mystuff://myjunk). Thanks to Remco for the patch.
        
        0.15.2
        ------
        
        - Update to move pth-files finder from the __init__ method to the
          install method so it runs in buildout-order, else it looks for pth
          files in dirs that may not yet exist. Thanks to Chris Shenton for
          the update to his original patch.
        
        0.15.1
        ------
        
        - Update to make the previously added pth-files option better
          documented.
        
        0.15
        ----
        
        - Added "pth-files" option to add libraries to extra-paths from

        ----
        
        - The recipe now supports creating a FCGI script. Thanks to Jannis
          Leidel for the patch.
        
        - When downloading a Django recipe for the first time the recipe now
          properly reports the url it is downloading from.

        - Specifying a user name within a subversion url now works. The code
          that determined the revision has been updated. This fixes issue
          #274004. Thanks to Remco for the patch.
        
        - Updated the template for creating new projects. It now uses the
          current admin system when generating it's `urls.py` file. This fixes
          issue #276255. Thanks to Roland for the patch.
        
        0.12.1
        ------
        
        - Re-upload since CHANGES.txt was missing from the release
        
        0.12
        ----
        
        - The recipe no longer executes subversion to determine whether the
          versions is to be downloaded using subversion. This fixes issue
          #271145. Thanks to Kapil Thangavelu for the patch.
        
        - Changed the `pythonpath` option to `extra-paths`. This makes the
          recipe more consistent with other recipes (see issue #270908).
        
        0.11
        ----
        
        - Another go at fixing the updating problem (#250811) by making sure
          the update method is always called. It would not be called in the
          previous version since the recipe wrote a random secret (if it
          wasn't specified) to the options for use with a template. Buildout
          saw this as a change in options and therefore always decided to
          un-install & install.
        
        - When both projectegg and wsgi=True are specified, the generated wsgi
          file did not have the correct settings file in it. This has been
          fixed with a patch from Dan Fairs.
        
        - The recipe now has logging. All print statements have been replaced
          and a few extra logging calls have been added. This makes the recipe
          more informative about long running tasks. Thanks erny for the patch
          from issue #260628.
        
        0.10
        ----
        
        - The recipe no longer expects the top level directory name in a
          release tarball to be consistent with the version number. This fixes
          issue #260097. Thanks to erny for reporting this issue and
          suggesting a solution.
        
        - Revision pinns for the svn checkout now stay pinned when re-running
          the buildout. This fixes issue #250811. Thanks to Remco for
          reporting this.
        
        - Added an option to specify an egg to use as the project. This
          disables the code which creates the basic project structure. Thanks
          to Dan Fairs for the patch from issue #252647.
        
        0.9.1
        -----
        
        - Fixed the previous release which was broken due to a missing
          manifest file
        
        0.9
        ---
        
        - The settings option is fixed so that it supports arbitrary depth
          settings paths (example; `conf.customer.development`).
        
        - The version argument now excepts a full svn url as well. You can use
          this to get a branch or fix any url to a specific revision with the
          standard svn @ syntax
        
        - The wsgi script is no longer made executable and readable only by
          the user who ran buildout. This avoids problems with deployment.
