Description: This simple recipe for zc.buildout fetches data from a given repository
        and stores it into its part's directory. A simple task using this
        could look like this::
        
            [myapp]
            recipe=zerokspot.recipe.git
            repository=git://github.com/zerok/zerokspot.gitrecipe.git
            rev=7c73978b55fcadbe2cd6f2abbefbedb5a85c2c8c
        
        This would store the repository under ${buildout:directory}/parts/myapp
        and keep it at exactly this revision, no matter what happens on the
        server.
        
        The recipe has following options:
        
        repository
            The absolute URL of the repository to be fetched
        
        rev
            A revision/commit within this repository the environment
            should use.
        
        branch
            If you want to stay up to date with a certain branch other than
            "master", use this.
        
        paths
            List of relative paths to packages to develop. Must be used together
            with as_egg=true.
        
        newest
            This overrides the newest-option of the global setting for this
            part
        
        as_egg
            Set to True if you want the checkout to be registered as a
            development egg in your buildout.
        
        cache-name
            Name of the repository in the download-cache directory.
        
        
        Offline installation
        --------------------
        
        If you want to install a part from the download-cache, this is now possible, too::
            
            [buildout]
            parts = myapp
            download-cache = /var/cache/buildout
            install-from-cache = true
        
            [mylib]
            recipe = zerokspot.recipe.git
            repository = http://domain.com/repo.git
        
        With this configuration, the recipe will look for /var/cache/buildout/repo and
        clone it into the local parts/ folder.
        
        The recipe also supports an additional "cache-name" setting that lets you
        configure the folder name of the repository in the download cache.
