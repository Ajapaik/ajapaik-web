Description: infrae.subversion
        =================
        
        This zc.buildout recipe will check out a *number* of URLs into its
        parts directory.  It won't remove its parts directory if there are any
        changes in the checkout, so it's safe to work with that checkout for
        development.
        
        This is an example buildout part that uses this recipe::
        
            [development-products]
            recipe = infrae.subversion
            urls =
                https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PDBDebugMode/trunk PDBDebugMode
        
        This will maintain a working copy of ``PDBDebugMode`` in the
        ``parts/development-products/PDBDebugMode`` directory (*not* in the
        parts directory itself).  Thus, the recipe handles multiple URLs fine.
        
        You can select a different location with ``location``, for instance::
        
           location = src
        
        Will extract ``PDBDebugMode`` in ``src/PDBDebugMode`` instead of
        ``parts``.
        
        If you have ``pysvn`` installed on the computer, it will be used. This
        implies better performances.
        
        Update
        ------
        
        By default, when buildout update the part, an ``svn up`` is done for
        each link. However, when a revision number is specified like this::
        
           https://svn.infrae.com/buildout/infrae.subversion/trunk@27829
        
        The SVN link is skipped for update. If you want to prevent update for
        all SVN link of the part even if they do not contain revision number,
        you can add the following option::
        
           ignore_updates = true
        
        Export
        ------
        
        With ``pysvn`` installed, you can specify::
        
           export = true
        
        in your buildout part to get an SVN export instead of an SVN checkout.
        
        Verification
        ------------
        
        By default, your checkout are checked against local modification
        before any uninstallation step. This can take time on large checkouts,
        and you may don't want it in some case (like when used on buildbot for
        instance). To prevent this step, you can use this option::
        
          ignore_verification = true
        
        As well, when the recipe update it can emit some warnings because a
        directory have been removed. You can suppress that warning with::
        
          no_warnings = true
        
        The verification will still be done, and the directory will be checked
        out again to replace the missing one.
        
        Eggs
        ----
        
        If you set the option ``as_eggs`` in your configuration file,
        checkouted URLs will be registered as development eggs in your
        buildout. This only work for non-recipe development eggs.
        
        .. warning:: If you add a new egg, this will trigger a new
          uninstall-reinstall cycle. You may want to use that option to setup
          eggs coming from SVN for production, but not for development.
        
        Exported Variables
        ------------------
        
        If you set::
        
          export_info = true
        
        Two variables will be exported by this recipe:
        
        - ``revisions`` which gives for each URL the corresponding revision
          number,
        
        - ``updated`` which gives a list of URLs which have been updated with
          new code.
        
        Since values to these variables changes each time you run buildout
        (revision number changes), this trigger an uninstall/reinstall of the
        part. We recommand to activate it only if you need it.
        
        Is always exported a variable ``location`` to say where are done the
        checkouts, and a variable ``eggs`` which contains a list of
        checkouted eggs.
        
        Sample
        ------
        
        For an example buildout that uses this recipe, please see the `Silva
        buildout <https://svn.infrae.com/buildout/silva/trunk>`_.
        
        As well, the `doctest file
        <https://svn.infrae.com/buildout/infrae.subversion/trunk/infrae/subversion/tests/IMPL.txt>`_
        can provide more sample.

        1.3.1
        ~~~~~
        
        Bug fix:

        - Add tests for export information feature. [tlotze]
